hi everyone,today I'm
going to share with you,one of my favorite sport game,so look at this first wo,yeah,ok,stop,the cool guy you seeï¼Œtouch basket and dunk shot that's me,

ok, I even show you my secret,ye I believe can fly,but look at this number,more important thing today im going to show you is if you believe you can fly too. 

so lets back to reality,haha,
ok,it's not because Im tall i can jump supper high,but the basket was changed, people think they can or cannot play basketball,normally depends on your body condition,or maybe we say it body restriction more exactly,because many times,you are told you cant you are not tall enough,you can't you are not strong enough. ye?

have you considered it's not you problem, it's just too high for the basket,rite, why not change it,those stop you to do it.

so this is the first point of this presentation, just do it ,dont care,what people think about you,dont care others eyes 

you may think the next is i show you what success I get to purswade you,to prove.

actually I didn't participate any formal basketball completion, I play myself offen 

i practice practice and practice,practice alone,how to shoot,how to make it better,

sometimes I gain inspired by the move,sometimes I just gain quiet and peace from it.

you may thought it's sound wired,but read this guy,kobe,

have you...

he always practice alone at midnight,

i should say he really touch me ,although he is not here anymore.

but everytime I practice alone and I remember him and his spritit 

so the last point I want to say,that is I want to supplement with nike slogan,just do it and do it alone 

thanks
